# SOPROJ11, Group Q

### Branching Rules
- For each userstory each user is allowed to make their own branch. The user branch should be directly based on dev and has the following format: `<UserstoryNr>_<User>`.
- Aside from user branches. Hotfix branches based on dev are also allowed.
- Main is updated once per sprint. (Every 2 weeks)

### Reviews
- 4 reviews are required to merge from dev into main.
- 2 reviews are required from any branch into dev. (Excluding the code owner's review)
- Reviews should come with useful feedback. Not just criticism.
- Use the Code Highlight tool.
- Merge conflicts should be solved by the merge request's owner.
